# Interview Scheduler

Welcome to my scheduler project!

This project was built using React

Some of the key features include:
* React Testing Library, Jest, and Cypress for thorough testing and ensuring high-quality code
* Custom hooks for efficient and flexible state management
* Axios for seamless API calls
* Storybook for easy component development and visualization
* UseState and useReducer for managing the app's state in a performant way

The scheduler allows users to create and manage appointments, making it perfect for businesses or individuals looking to streamline their scheduling process. The user interface is intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to people of all skill levels.

I have used Cypress for end-to-end testing and Jest for unit testing to ensure that the app is functioning correctly and efficiently. I also utilized Storybook to develop and document the UI components in isolation.

Additionally, I have created custom hooks to manage the state of the scheduler and make it more reusable.

Here's a demo of the scheduler in action:
